# MATPLOTLIB PROBLEM # 1
# Chicago Public Library Computer Usage (15pts)
# open and read in the "Libraries_-_2018_Visitors_by_Location.csv" file into a list (use file located in the file folder, read in using csv library).
# calculate (and make a list of) the total visitors to Chicago libraries each month.  
# Do not plot every library individually.  Instead, find the total for all libraries each month and plot that.
# Make a BAR GRAPH with the total visitors on the y and month on the x.  
# label the x with the month.  Rotate the text so we can read it.  (see example problem).  Use the tight_fit command to show all text.
# label axes, title the graph as necessary.

# Chicago Public Transit Usership Graph (20pts)
# go to https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Annual-Boarding-Totals/w8km-9pzd
# download the CTA ridership data as a csv.

# Make each line, points, and color different for the four graphs.
# Make a legend to identify each line.
# Label axes and give your graph a title.  Change it in any other way you see necessary to give it a clean look.
