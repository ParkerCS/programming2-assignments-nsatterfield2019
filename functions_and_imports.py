#PROBLEM 1 (how many upper case - 4pts)

# The function then prints the largest, the smallest, and their average, rounded to 2 decimals.
# Display the answers in a "nicely" formatted way.

# PROBLEM 4 (add me, multiply me - 4pts)
# Make a function which takes in two integers and RETURNS their sum AND their product.

# PROBLEM 5 (Login - 4pts)
# Make a file called import_me.py in this same project
# Inside this new module/file, make a login function which works according to the flow diagram PasswordFlowchart.png in this folder
# Substitute your name for Rohan's, and use whatever generic password you want.

# PROBLEM 6 (main - 4pts)
# import the file import_me from Problem 5
# Create a main program using the format if __name__ == "__main__": 
# Place every call from problems 1 through 5 into this program.
