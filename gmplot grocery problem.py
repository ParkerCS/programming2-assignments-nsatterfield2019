# In 2013, an interesting dataset was released for Chicago which identified a number of food deserts.
# In many areas of the city, there were no suitable grocery stores with adequate produce, meats, refrigerated, and frozen food sections
# Many areas were only served by corner stores and convenience stores.

# Using gmplot and the chicago grocery csv, which contains updated grocery store data, 
# create a map with the following characteristics.
# - Map is centered on Chicago at a zoom level that shows all stores (5pts)
# - All adequate grocery stores are plotted (could be scatterplot, circles, or markers) (use the one looks best to you) (10pts)
#   Inadequate grocery stores are NOT plotted (you decide what inadequate means)
# - Shows a heatmap which helps to visualize the greatest concentration of adequate stores. (10pts) 
#   Your heatmap should be optimized for the city level view.  Tweak the radius and maxIntensity to adjust blob.


# Challenges:  
# Instead of a heatmap, make each store a circle with varying size based on square footage of the store.  
# Filter out all liquor stores, drug stores, and convenience stores.
# Place markers or other indicators where you still see inadequate food access.
